<p>My name is Eike E. Köhn and I am a <a href=_pages/cv.md>physical oceanographer by training</a>, who has ventured into the world of marine biogeochemistry. 
    I am currently working as a PostDoc in the lab of Prof. Nicolas Gruber at ETH Zürich, where I continue to work on <a href=_pages/research.md>marine extreme events</a>, which was the topic of my recently finished PhD thesis.</p>
