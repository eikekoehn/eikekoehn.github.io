<p>Hi there, my name is Eike and I am a <a href=./cv>physical oceanographer by training</a>, who has ventured into the world of marine biogeochemistry. I am currently working as a Postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.locean.ipsl.fr/">LOCEAN</a>, where I investigate <a href="https://www.tipesm.eu/">tipping points in Earth System Models</a>. Before coming to Paris, I did my PhD at ETH Zurich on <a href=./research>marine extreme events</a>, such as marine heatwaves and extreme oxygen minimum zone variability.</p>
