<p>Hi there, I am a <a href=./cv>physical oceanographer by training</a>, who has ventured into the world of marine biogeochemistry. 
    I am currently working as a Postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.locean.ipsl.fr/">LOCEAN</a>, where I investigate <a href="https://www.tipesm.eu/">tipping points in Earth System Models</a>. Before coming to Paris, I did my PhD at ETH Zurich (in the group of Prof. Nicolas Gruber) on <a href=./research>marine extreme events</a>, such as marine heatwaves and extreme oxygen minimum zone variability.</p> 

<p>On this website you can find information about:</p>

    <li><a href=./cv>my scientific background and path</a> </li>
    <li><a href=./research>my research interests</a></li>
    <li><a href=./publications>an overview over my publications.</a></li>
