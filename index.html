<p>My name is Eike E. Köhn and I am a <a href=./cv>physical oceanographer by training</a>, who has ventured into the world of marine biogeochemistry. 
    I am currently working as a PostDoc in the <a href="https://www.up.ethz.ch/">Environmental Physics lab</a> of Prof. Nicolas Gruber at ETH Zürich, where I continue to investigate <a href=./research>marine extreme events</a> using a regional ocean model, which was also the topic of my recently finished PhD thesis.</p>
