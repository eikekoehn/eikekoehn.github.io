**Marine heatwaves (MHWs)** are defined as discrete periods of exceptionally high water temperatures, typically measured at the sea surface. Over the last decades the intensity and frequency of such MHWs has increased (), posing an increasing threat to marine life. 
For some of these MHWs, profound consequences for marine organisms and ecosystems have been observed.
