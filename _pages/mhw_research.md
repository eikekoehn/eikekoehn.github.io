**Marine heatwaves (MHWs)** are defined as discrete periods of exceptionally high water temperatures (Fig. 1). Such anomalously warm periods can have profound consequences for marine organisms and ecosystems.
As the intensity and frequency of MHWs has increased over the last decades, and is projected to do so further in the future, they pose an increasing threat to marine life. MHWs are commonly detected at the sea surface, guided by the availability of satellite based measurements of sea surface temepratures (SST). Yet, the habitats of many marine organisms span the upper ocean water column, suggesting that temperature extremes beneath the well-mixed surface ocean (i.e., the mixed layer) are of similar relevance for marine life. To date, research on such subsurface MHWs is limited. 

In my research, I try to overcome this knowledge gap and extend the view on MHWs beyond the sea surface. In order to do so, I rely on data from high resolution regional ocean model simulations, which reproduces the upper ocean state as realistically as possible.

Figure 1: Sketch of the MHW definition following Hobday et al. (2016, 2018). Marine heatwaves (MHWs) and marine coldspells (MCS) are defined as instances where the temperature leaves the "normal" variability range, defined by the 90th and 10th percentile of the seasonally varying temperature distribution. Hence, the temperature deviates more than one $$\varepsilon_{p90}$$ ($$\varepsilon_{p10}$$) from the climatological value. Hobday et al. (2018) proposed to categorize the MHWs by the maximum temperature deviation expressed in terms of multiples of $$\varepsilon$$ (indicated by the different intensities of oranges/purples). The example temperature time series is created as an AR(1) process, using a temporal autocorrelation of 0.99 and noise from the standard normal distribution.
