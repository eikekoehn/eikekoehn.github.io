**Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs)** are water volumes of the global ocean that are characterized by very low concentrations of dissolved oxygen. Such highly deoxygenated water masses can be found roughly between 100 and 1000m depth in distinct regions of the global ocean. The most extensive of these OMZs are located in the eastern tropical Pacific, the eastern tropical north Atlantic, off the coast of Namibia as well as in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean. In all of these regions, the OMZs are formed naturally by a pronounced biologically driven removal of dissolved oxygen, while the replenishment of dissolved oxygen through physical transport processes is only weak. The oxygen removal is mainly driven mirobes that require oxygen for their metabolism as they remineralize sinking organic material. The oxygen replenishment or "ventilation" of OMZs is achieved by differnt physical pathways, such as the transport with persistent or transient currents ("advection") or through lateral and vertical mixing.

Small changes to the delicate balance between the biological oxygen consumption (mainly by microbes) and physical oxygen replenishment can lead to notable changes in the volumes of OMZs...
