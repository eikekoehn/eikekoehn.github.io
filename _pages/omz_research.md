**Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs)** are water volumes of the global ocean that are characterized by very low concentrations of dissolved oxygen. Such highly deoxygenated water masses can be found roughly between 100 and 1000m depth in distinct regions of the global ocean. The most extensive of these OMZs are located in the eastern tropical Pacific, the eastern tropical north Atlantic, off the coast of Namibia as well as in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean. Other marginal seas, such as the Baltic Sea or the Black Sea, also host OMZs in the subsurface. In all of these regions, the OMZs are formed by a pronounced biologically driven removal of dissolved oxygen, while the replenishment of dissolved oxygen through physical transport processes is only weak. The oxygen removal is mainly driven by mirobes that require oxygen for their metabolism as they remineralize sinking organic material. The oxygen replenishment or "ventilation" of OMZs is achieved by differnt physical pathways, such as through the transport with persistent or transient currents ("advection") or through lateral and vertical mixing.

Within the above named OMZs, dissolved oxygen concentrations drop to hypoxic levels ($$[O_2] < 60$$ mmol m$$^{-3}$$) and can in some cases reach anoxic conditions, i.e., conditions where dissolved oxygen is virtually absent. These strongly deoxygenated waters represent a very different environment than the rest of the ocean, where dissolved oxygen is plentiful. As many heterotrophic organisms require oxygen for their metabolism and thus cannot thrive within OMZs, OMZs are also often referred to as "dead zones". Yet, some organisms are adapted to low oxygen environments and find their ecological niche within the OMZs. 

As the global ocean is currently warming up as a result of anthropogenically driven climate change, the ocean is also experiencing a deoxygenation trend. As such, the ocean has lost about 2% of its dissolved oxygen over the last 50 years. The majority of this deoxygenation can be attributed to the fact that warmer waters can hold dissolved gases to a lesser degree. Yet, also other processes, such as the increasing temperature difference between the sea surface and the subsurface ocean (refered to as "stratification") and the resulting suppression of vertical water exchange play an important role in the oxygen depletion in the ocean interior. 

Small changes to the delicate balance between the biological oxygen consumption and physical oxygen replenishment can lead to notable changes in the volumes of OMZs. Indeed, observations suggest that in line with the global deoxygenation trend, the OMZs are horizontally and vertically expanding. Yet, the future evolution of the individual OMZs is still under investigation. A complicating factor in this research is the fact that OMZs show pronounced variability in their size, position and intensity across a broad range of time scales, ranging from subseasonal to (inter-)decadal variability. 

In my research I study this variability of OMZs. For instance, I investigate the extreme variability of the OMZs in the Eastern Pacific, the largest volumes of hypoxic to anoxic waters found on our planet. In this research I am particularly interested in those periods, where the OMZs come extremely close to the sea surface. Such anomalous shoaling (i.e., upward movement) of the OMZs can transiently compress the vertical habitat of oxygen-requiring heterotrophic organisms. In order to better anticipate such extremes and study their ecosystem impacts, I quantify the extreme habitat compression and analyze the underlying driving mechanisms in [Köhn et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JC018429), using a simulation performed with a regional ocean model (ROMS). 
The research into such extremes has the potential to provide a window into the future and reveal what a more deoxygenated ocean will look like.
