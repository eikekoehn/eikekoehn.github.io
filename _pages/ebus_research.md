**Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS)** are distinct regions on the eastern sides of most ocean basins, marked by a winddriven upward movement of waters. The most iconic of these EBUS are found along the coast of California, Peru/Chile, Mauretania/Senegal, Namibia and western India. These regions are generally marked by relatively cold surface waters, as the upward water movement, i.e., the upwelling, transports colder subsurface waters to the surface. As these cold subsurface waters are also enriched in nutrients, the upwelling brings these nutrients to the sunlit surface ocean, where phytoplankton species can utilize them to build up organic matter through photosynthesis. This high availability of organic matter sustains very productive and diverse ecosystems, from which humans strongly benefit. EBUS contribute to about 10% of marine fish catch, despite making up only 1% of the global ocean. Due to this important ecosystem service, it is necessary to understand what the future of EBUS will bring as our planet warms - a topic of ongoing scientific research.

The upwelled waters are furthermore enriched in carbon dioxide (CO$$_2$$), as the ocean interior stores a large amount of this greenhouse gas. To which degree the upwelling-driven elevated carbon dioxide levels at the sea surface lead to a flux of carbon from the ocean into the atmosphere, differs between the individual EBUS, as this aspect depends on a complex balance between physical and biological processes. The Peru/Chile upwelling system is generally considered as a region where CO$$_2$$ outgasses from the ocean into the atmosphere. However, this outgassing is not a steady process, but is subject to strong variability due to the varying winds and the regions intense mesoscale and submesoscale variability. In [Köhn et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.5194/os-13-1017-2017), we investigate the spatiotemporal variability of this air-sea CO$$_2$$ flux in a very localized area off Peru, where we find very pronounced variability on the order of a few hours and kilometers.
